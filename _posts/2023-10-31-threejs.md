I wanted to experiment with [three.js](https://threejs.org/), epsecially with
animation of models like in 
[this example from three.js](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_skinning_additive_blending).

What I ended up with is in the
[repository](https://github.com/aabeling/something-with-threejs) (tag `jointed-doll`).

I am not good in typescript, so please be lenient.

The app allows to move the different bones of the model separately.

Models come from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) and some are converted with
[https://github.com/facebookincubator/FBX2glTF](https://github.com/facebookincubator/FBX2glTF).

While mixamo already provides a lot of animations, my long-term goal is to provide an app with which
animations can be defined by snapshots of the model in different positions at different times.
The animation is then some kind of interpolation through these snapshots. E.g. the following two snapshots could be animated into a jumping model:

![Snapshot1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/threejs_position1.png) | ![Snapshot2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/threejs_position2.png)
